ðŸ•¹ How to Play Mr. Blanks

Mr. Blanks is in danger â€” and only you can save him!

Each round, youâ€™ll see a mysterious clue that describes a hidden word.
Your mission is to guess the word letter by letter, using the clue to guide you.You have 7 chances to guess wrong.Each incorrect letter brings Mr. Blanks one step closer to being hanged.Guess all the letters correctly before the 7th mistakeâ€¦ and Mr. Blanks lives!But if you failâ€¦ well, you know whatÂ happens.Â ðŸ’€

***
### ***Pseudo-code***
- Starts the game	Game: shows a clue and blanks for the word

-Enters a correct letter: 	The letter is revealed in the correct position(s) in the word

- Enters a wrong letter	: Every time you make a mistake, the letter turns red, and one part of Mr. Blanks is drawn: first his head, then his body, followed by his right arm, left arm, right leg, left leg â€” and on the seventh mistake, his eyes are drawnâ€¦ and he's dead.

- Repeats a guessed letter	Warning is shown: "You already guessed that!"

- Guesses all letters	Game ends with a win message: "You saved Mr. Blanks!"

-Makes 7 wrong guesses	Game ends with a lose message: "Mr. Blanks is gone..."
- Clicks "Play Again"	A new game round begins with a new word and clue
